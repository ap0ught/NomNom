## Manager

* Select slot and save you want to edit.
    * Slot selection displays play time and last save timestamp of most recent
      save.
    * Save selection displays further details like the type, its game version,
      and some states.
        * **Compatible**: The save is fully compatible and can be loaded for use
          in Editor and Guide pages.
        * **Corrupted**: The save might be compatible but at least the related
          meta information does not match the actual save data. If a save is
          corrupted, it cannot be loaded by the game. In order to fix this, you
          just need to save it with NomNom (even if you haven't changed
          anything). But if the save is also compatible, you can edit it before
          saving if you want to.
        * **Synced**: Indicates whether the current state of the save is the
          same as on the disk.
* Delete, copy, move, or swap your slots (unlocked platform dependent).
